# .files
The files that make my computer my computer.

While these technically aren't .files (I use Windows. Hey, I'm working on moving to Linux! Probably. Maybe.), they're the things that make my software look, feel, and act like my software.

This encompasses multiple things. Mostly my config files and my wallpapers. I organized them in a nice fashion for y'all to see what's what, and for my wallpapers, who drew the art.
